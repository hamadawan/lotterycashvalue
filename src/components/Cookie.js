        <p>
          Our website www.LotteryCashValue.com uses cookies. By using our website and service you consent to the use of cookies.
          This Cookies Policy explains what cookies are, how we use them, how third parties we partner with may use them, your choices regarding cookies and more information about cookies.
        </p>
        <h3>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h3>
        <p>
          A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.
          When a cookie file is stored in your web browser, it allows for a service or third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the service more useful to you.
          Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
        </p>
